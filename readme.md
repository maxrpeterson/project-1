Click on the products you would like to purchase which will add them to a tab on the side. Once you have an order filled, click the "checkout" button and it will be added to the order history at the bottom. 

You can also adjust the price for an item on an order by typing into the input box on the right. Once you hit "enter", the price will update and the total will be updated. If you type a non-number, the price will be set back to the last price entered/original price.

Once an order is in the History section, you can click on it to open a panel listing the items from the order.
